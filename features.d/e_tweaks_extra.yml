tweaks.extra.no_dinnerlava:
	name: No Dinnerlava
	since: 1.3.2
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Disables the generation of 1 block hidden lava pockets in the Nether. They were initially
		added to discourage stripmining in the Nether for quartz, but now that Netherite exists,
		which can only be reasonably obtained via stripmining, it's just frustrating for no real
		reason.

		"Dinnerlava" refers to the fact this was part of a series of changes all made by Dinnerbone
		in a short span of time in the 1.5 era mostly on provocation from Vechs of Super Hostile
		fame.

		Will not take effect unless the world is reloaded.
